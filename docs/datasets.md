# Exemplar Microscopy Images of Tissues (EMIT)

MCMICRO is accompanied by EMIT (Exemplar Microscopy Images of Tissues), which is a reference dataset of multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy images collected at the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School with NCI funding. EMIT includes a set of images of different types for development and benchmarking of computational methods for image processing. The data are also expected to be useful for biological studies. However, the data are complex and annotation for the purposes of biological interpretation is an ongoing activity. Users of these data should expect to see updates and additions; these will be versioned and made backwards compatible whenever possible.

Presently, EMIT comprises one tissue microarray (TMA) dataset and one whole-slide image (WSI) dataset.

## Tissue microarrays (TMAs)

The TMA contains cores from 34 cancer, non-neoplastic diseases, and normal tissues collected from clinical discards under an IRB-supervised protocol. The TMA was imaged using the [cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) method](https://www.cycif.org/) described in [Lin et al 2018](https://elifesciences.org/articles/31657). Data were collected with a 20X magnification, 0.75 NA objective with 2x2-pixel binning using two multiplex antibody panels (on section 11 “TMA11” and section 22 “TMA22").
